1. In 2021, Zhang, et al. [14] have suggested a CNN that is densely connected and has a connection-wise attention system to acquire the multi-level features of brain MRI for the purpose of classifying AD.
  •	Limited exploration of drawbacks provided.
  • Integration of multiple modalities can increase computational complexity.

2. In 2016, Beheshti et al. [16] have established an automatic CAD system for AD classification using seven feature-ranking approaches and classification errors.
  •	Early diagnosis of AD using brain connectivity and clinical data.

3. In 2021, Ebrahimi, et al. [18] have presented the use of CNN on MRI to identify AD.
  •	Training 3D CNNs from scratch performed poorly on MRI dataset.

4. In 2019, Maqsood et al. [17] have used an effective, automated Alzheimer’s classifcation system formulated using transfer learning, addressing binary and multi-class tasks (stage detection).
  •	Need to analyze accuracy by fine-tuning all convolutional layer.

5. Ju et al. 2017.
  •	Need for evaluation on larger datasets.
